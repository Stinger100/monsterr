# monsterr

### Prerequisites

You will most definitely need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and `npm` (comes with Node.js).

### Installation
Once you've installed Node.js you can create your project:
```
mkdir project_name && cd project_name && npm init -f
```
This will create a simple `npm` project for you with default values that you can change later.


Install `monsterr` using `npm`:

```
npm install monsterr --save
```

This will also create `client.js`, `server.js` and a `logs` directory.

Simply run:
```
node server
```
to start the server.

Access the application at http://localhost:3000. Yay!
