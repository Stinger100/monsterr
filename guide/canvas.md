# Canvas
On the client you get access to the `canvas` object, simply accessed with `monsterr.canvas`.
Furthermore another very important object is available: `fabric`.
Fabric.js is the framework powering the canvas. Through the `fabric` object you can access the full width of Fabric.js features. Use the `fabric` object to create objects that you can then add to the canvas. See [Fabric.js](http://fabricjs.com), their [guide](http://fabricjs.com/articles/) or their [documentation](http://fabricjs.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the `fabric` object, how to create, add, remove and manipulate objects on the canvas.
Fabric.js also comes with a powerful [event system](http://fabricjs.com/fabric-intro-part-2#events) that allows you to attach event handlers to objects and thereby record user actions and react on them.

## Methods
```js
canvas.add(/* fabric object */);
```

## Options
The available network related options (and their defaults) are:
```js
options = {
  staticCanvas: false,          // objects on the canvas are dynamic and can be moved, resized and more
  canvasBackgroundColor: '#999' // the canvas is per default grey
}
```
