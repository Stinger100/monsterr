# Network
On the server you get access to the `network` object, simply accessed with `monsterr.network`. This object will in the future allow you to do things like shuffle the groups and dynamically change group size and network graph.

## Options
The available network related options (and their defaults) are:
```js
options = {
  groupSize: 2 // the size of the groups clients are placed in
}
```
